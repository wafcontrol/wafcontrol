# OWASP WAFControl

The **OWASP WAFControl** project provides a web-based dashboard and management interface for ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS).  
It simplifies installation, configuration, and operation of CRS and ModSecurity, enabling administrators and security engineers to deploy, monitor, and manage WAF rules more effectively.

WAFControl integrates rule management, attack monitoring, and configuration control into one centralized platform, making it easier to maintain strong web application security with reduced complexity.
